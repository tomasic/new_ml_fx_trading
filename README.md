Machine learning enhanced foreign exchange trading, built as the reference implementation for the paper **"ForExAI: Time Series Inference and News Article Analysis Reveal Profitable Foreign Exchange Signals"** (Lemeneh et al., *Mathematics* 2026, 14, 2319).

## Why this repo

Most FX trading repos are either a single notebook with a moving average crossover, or a black box with no evaluation. This one is neither. It is a full research grade pipeline: clean and split time series data, train and benchmark six forecasting approaches (classical, neural, and zero shot foundation models), extract trading signals from news articles with LLMs, size every position with an adapted Kelly criterion, and validate every result with permutation tests and bootstrap confidence intervals. You can run it end to end on your own FX data, swap in a new currency pair, or just borrow the Kelly sizing logic for your own strategy.

## Key Results

Results below are from the paper's out of sample test period (September 2024 through July 2025 for USD/CNY and USD/BRL, extended through December 2025 for USD/EUR and USD/GBP), starting from $1,000,000 in capital.

| Currency Pair | Best Model (Active Kelly) | Avg. Cumulative Profit | Sharpe Ratio | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| USD/BRL | Ensemble | ~$1.07M | 7.66 | ARIMA alone reached ~$2.05M ACP |
| USD/CNY | Ensemble | ~$25.6K | 3.48 | Weak signal, consistent with a managed exchange rate |
| USD/GBP | Mean Reversion | ~$43.1K | 2.28 | Best Sharpe ratios across all four pairs were modest |
| USD/EUR | Ensemble | ~$109.9K | 2.82 | Best in class on both cumulative profit and Sharpe |

A few findings worth knowing before you dive into the code:

- **Zero shot foundation models punch above their weight.** Chronos-Bolt and Toto, used with no task specific fine tuning, achieved the lowest prediction error (RMSE, MASE, MAPE) of any model across all four currency pairs.
- **Short prompts beat expert prompts.** For LLM based news sentiment, simple prompts like "buy, sell, or hold" consistently outperformed long, econometrically informed expert prompts, sometimes by a factor of 100.
- **Transaction costs matter a lot.** At $2.50 per order, fixed position sizing strategies are wiped out across the board due to trade frequency. Kelly based strategies survive better, and on USD/BRL the ARIMA and ensemble strategies remain profitable even after costs.
- **The Kelly criterion helps.** An adapted Kelly criterion, weighted by both historical win rate and predicted trade size, consistently increased cumulative profit relative to fixed bet sizing, though it did not always improve the Sharpe ratio.

See Sections 12 through 18 of the paper for the full breakdown by currency pair, including validation tuning, statistical significance testing, and the effect of trading thresholds.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing and Management:** A pipeline to clean, scale, and split financial time series data for training and evaluation.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), N-BEATS, and N-HiTS on historical data, and incorporates zero shot forecasters (Toto, Chronos-Bolt) that require no task specific training.
- **Trading Strategy Implementation:** Mean reversion, pure forecasting, hybrid, and news sentiment strategies, each sized with the Kelly criterion.
- **Kelly Criterion for Bet Sizing:** Determines the optimal fraction of the wallet to invest per trade, using both win/loss history and predicted gain.
- **Visualization of Predictions and Profits:** Generates actual vs. predicted price plots alongside profit curves.
- **Simulation of Trading Strategies:** Backtests strategies over a historical period before you'd ever risk real capital.

## Dataset

Before training or evaluating models and running trading simulations, prepare two datasets: one for FX market data and one for news sentiment data. Don't have FX price or news sentiment data on hand? The [dataset](https://github.com/bkmulusew/ml_fx_trading/tree/main/dataset) folder in this repo includes ready to use FX prices and news sentiments so you can run the pipeline end to end right after cloning, before plugging in your own data.

### FX Dataset

The FX dataset provides historical exchange rate information, formatted as follows:

| date              | bid_price | ask_price | mid_price |
| :---------------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| 2/3/2023 16:56    | 6.8004    | 6.8004    | 6.8004    |
| 2/3/2023 16:57    | 6.8038    | 6.8038    | 6.8038    |
| 2/3/2023 16:58    | 6.8036    | 6.8036    | 6.8036    |
| 2/3/2023 16:59    | 6.8050    | 6.8050    | 6.8050    |

- **date**: Timestamp of each FX data point.
- **bid_price**: Price at which the market is willing to buy Currency B using Currency A.
- **ask_price**: Price at which the market is willing to sell Currency B using Currency A.
- **mid_price**: Average of bid and ask prices.

### News Dataset

The News dataset provides sentiment labels for financial news headlines and articles, formatted as follows:

| date              | label_1 | label_2 | label_3 |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| 2/3/2023 16:56    | 0       | 1       | 1       |
| 2/3/2023 16:57    | 1       | 0       | 0       |
| 2/3/2023 16:58    | -1      | 1       | 0       |
| 2/3/2023 16:59    | 0       | 1       | 0       |

- **date**: Timestamp of each news data point.
- **label_1, label_2, label_3**: Sentiment signals automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).
  - `0`: Neutral sentiment.
  - `1`: News favorable to Currency B (or less favorable to Currency A).
  - `-1`: News favorable to Currency A (or less favorable to Currency B).

Multiple sentiment columns are provided so you can experiment with different labeling schemes. Select which sentiment source to use with the `--sentiment_source` flag, for example `--sentiment_source label_2`.

Results in the paper are reported without transaction costs unless explicitly stated otherwise. As shown in Section 18, transaction costs materially change the profitability picture. This project is a research tool for studying signal detection in FX markets, not a ready made trading system.
